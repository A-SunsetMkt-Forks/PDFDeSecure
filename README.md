# 🛡️ PDFDeSecure

**PDFDeSecure** is a free, open-source tool to remove restrictions from PDF files (e.g. printing, editing, copying), especially when DRM-like protections are applied.

> 📂 Unlock your PDFs from "secured" printing mode in seconds.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Removes PDF security restrictions (print/copy/edit)
- 💡 No need to know the password (if only usage rights are locked)
- 🔐 Works on Adobe LiveCycle DRM-protected PDFs
- 🖥️ CLI support and optional UI
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — built with C#/.NET
- 💻 Cross-platform via .NET (Windows, Linux, macOS*)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Download

Grab the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/abatsakidis/pdfdesecure/releases).

Or clone the repo and build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abatsakidis/pdfdesecure.git
cd pdfdesecure
dotnet build
```

### 🖱️ Usage

```bash
PDFDeSecure.exe input.pdf output.pdf
```

That’s it! Your output PDF will be unrestricted.

### 📚 How it Works

PDFDeSecure bypasses usage restrictions by re-rendering the document as a new PDF, preserving layout and content while discarding the security flags.

⚠️ It does not attempt to crack password-encrypted PDFs (e.g. owner/user password protected).
